where are the robots:    
        "robots" in a web exploitation test reminds me of robots.txt: The text file that tells search engines which parts of the website is fair game. So,   
        - Access robots.txt by {link}/robots.txt  
        - Given: Disallow: (something).html  
        - GOTO {link}/(something).html and take the flag  

Insp3ct0r:  
        Challenge repeatedly references html, css and js. Hence, visit the html, css and js files of given website afnd look at the comments.

Apparently the next part(s) of the flag are in apache files. So, using dirsearch command we gan get a list of publicly available files.
Files:

Hint: I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
