                        $ file (filename)
                    we know that it is an ELF exeutable. So, give it execution permissions adn run it.
                        $ ./(filename)
                        Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
                    We give it what it wishes for!
                        # ./(fileneame) -h      # -h stands for help. For any binary in linux you can find a small version of its instruction manual using this.
                        Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: {required_flag}

                    We need to first access its metadata to snif for interesting information. Go to exifinfo.org or metadata2go.com and upload the file.
                    Hmm the license looks kinda fishy... It looks like base64.
                    Go to any online decoder and paste the so-called license number. You will get the {required_flag}

Nice  netcat...:    Use the given code snippet. Here, it runs netcat (nc) to access the website (mercury.picoctf.net) on port number (whatever number)
                    The output will seemingly be a column of numbers. Copy the numbers into a new textfile using:
                        $ (netcat code) > (filename).txt        # The > operator dumps output from the left hand side into the right. If the named file does not exist, a new empty file is created.
                    We then create a new python file in the same dorectory as that of the above (filename).txt:
                        a_file = open("(filename).txt")                 # opens (filename).txt that was present in the same directory as this .py is    
                        content = tuple(a_file.read().split("\n"))      # splits the content around "\n" (newline) and adds the split content into a tuple
                        res = ''.join(map(chr, map(int, content[:-1]))) # map(int, x) converts all elements of tuple into int (except the last one which was a whitespace)
                                                                        # map(chr,x) converts the integer elements into text
                                                                        # ''.join() joins all converted elements into a string
                        print ("Resultant string", str(res))            # Printing final string, which contains the {required_flag}

Magikarp Ground Mission: 
                    Start instance and copy-paste connection info to terminal
                    Type passsword when asked.
                    When you see a .txt file by the name of {num}of3.flag.txt, 
                        $ cat {num}of3.flag.txt                          # cat prints the content of file in the terminal. Also, use tabs for automatic command completion.
                    Copy the output
                    Follow instructions.
                        $ cat __                                         # prints content
                        $ cd __                                          # change directory
                    If you are unsire about the type of any file do:
                        $ file __                                        # output file metadata

Lets Warm Up:       Hexadecimal 0x70 corresponds to the letter 'p'. So,
                    {required_flag} = picoCTF{p}
                    
Warmed Up:          Hexadecimal 0x3D corresponds to the decimal 61. So,
                    {required_flag} = picoCTF{61}

2 Warm:             integer 42 corresponds to the binary 101010. So,
                    {required_flag} = picoCTF{101010}

Tab, Tab, Attack:   Download zip file
                    Unzip using:
                        $ unzip (file)
                    Recursively do:
                        $ cd *                                           # * means all characters, so if there is a directory named github then I can access it using $cd g*b (only is there are no other repositories which start with g and end with b)
                    Until you reach the last file, which is an ELF.
                        $ ./*                                            # * is a bash wildcard. Also, read about regex its pretty interesting.
                    You will get the {required_flag}

strings it:         File is an EOF, and if we cat its contents it will blow up the terminal # if terminal blows up use ctrl+c and then the command clear.
                    In hints it tells us about the command 'strings', which prints all printable strings (character sequences) in the cat of that file.
                        $ strings {filename}
                    It will print too many strings one by one. Here, command 'grep' can be used to find stuff.
                        $ strings {filename} | grep picoCTF              # | means piping: where the returned value of the first command can be 'piped' into the second command as an input.
                        picoCTF{required_flag}                           # We grepped picoCTF because we know tat the flag starts with picoCTF

Bases:              Online decode from base64
                    You will get your {required_flag}

First Grep:         Download file,
                        $ cat {filename} | grep picoCTF
                        {required_flag}

Based:              Since the name is 'Based', we can conclude that it will probably give us values of different bases and tell us to convert them.
                    On running the given netcat code we can see that it gives us text which has to be converted to plaintext.
                    The most common bases are binary (base2), octal (base8), ASCII (base10) and hex (base16). Hence I created a python file which takes in the input and gives text output.
                    
plumbing:           Connect using given data and pipe.
                        $ nc (data given) | grep picoCTF
                        picoCTF{required_flag}
                    
mus1c:              The text given is weird lyrics. In the hint it says: "Do you think you can master rockstar?" so I searched "rockstar programming".
                    There is a programming language called rockstar.
                    Go to your favourite web browser and go to any online rockstar interpreter and paste the lyrics in it. It will output many numbers line by line.
                    Since we can observe that such numbers look line octals, write a code to convert octals to text and you will get your {required_flag}.

flag_shop:          On studying the source we can see that acount_balance is a small number. And, in line 42 there is no condition where the case of total cost > account_balance.
                    So it can be inferred that the balance can go into negative numbers.
                    But, since account_balance is a small number, if we subract sufficiently large numbers (900*number_flags) from it it will overflow and display a positive number. 
                    Process:
                        Go to 1. Defintely not the flag Flag menu
                        Buy a verry large number (I used 23472156)
                            The final cost is: -349896080
                            Your current balance after transaction: 349897180
                    Now you can buy the 1337 flag!!!                       # 1337 corresponds to leet, which can mean elite. Comeon leetcode, anyone?
                        
1_wanna_b3_a_r0ck5tar:
                    Since this is the rockstar language it will be straightforward if you take time to understand it. Else, u can convert (transpile) it to a known language for easy comprehension.
                    Visit https://codewithrockstar.com/code and install whichever is easy for you. I installed rockstar-py.
                    Transpile the code and study it.
                    We can see that to reach the important chunk of code, we have to input 2 values (2 input()) and pass through two if statements.
                    One way to get the answer is to modify the rockstar code itself. Else we follow the code and beat it in its own turf!!!
                    The initialized values:
                        rockstar: Rocknroll is right                        python  : Rocknroll = True       
                        rockstar: Silence is wrong                          python  : Silence = False       
                        rockstar: A guitar is a six-string                  python  : a_guitar = 10
                        rockstar: Tommy's been down                         python  : Tommy = 44
                        rockstar: Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!  python  : Music = 170
                    We can see that the parts of importance are:
                        rockstar: Listen to the music                       python  : the_music = input()
                        rockstar: If the music is a guitar                  python  : if the_music == a_guitar:
                    and, 
                        rockstar: Listen to the rhythm                      python  : the_rhythm = input()
                        rockstar: If the rhythm without Music is nothing    python  : if the_rhythm - Music == False:
                    Clearly, we have to equate the_music == a_guitar and the_rhythm - Music == 0.
                    Procedure:
                        Go to https://codewithrockstar.com/online, paste the code and in input type:
                            10
                            170
                    A column of numbers will appear which look like ASCII values.
                    Convert ASCII values to simpletext
